## Singly Linked List
* Each piece in a linked list is connected by nodes. 
* Each node has a pointer called next and a data value. 
* We form a linked list by chaining pointers to each other by setting the value equal to the next node. The last pointer next is set to NULLPTR
* Linked list are allocated in heap
* When we set something equal to an instance of a class, it gives us the objects address memory location. 
* So we set node 1.next = node2
